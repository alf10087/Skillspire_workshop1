```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r cars}
data_r <- read.csv("data/ds_salaries.csv")
```

## Let's do some basic regression!

A basic OLS regression will explore the relationship between salary and several variables:

```{r}
model1 <- lm(salary_in_usd ~ experience_level + company_size + factor(work_year), data = data_r)
summary(model1)
```

We can also do a logistic regression, to explore associations with a binary variable in the left hand side:

```{r}
data_r <- data_r %>% 
  mutate(remote = ifelse(remote_ratio == 100, 1, 0))
model2 <- lm(remote ~ experience_level + company_size + factor(work_year), data = data_r)
summary(model1)
```

Note that these need to be transformed into odds ratios for full intepretability.
